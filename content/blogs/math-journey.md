*I wish I could say I had loved Mathematics all my life, but that is not the case.*

<!--more-->
On many accounts, the proudest achievement I had within my mathematics journey was to reach the USAJMO stage in 10th grade. When my teacher told me the news, instead of a bolt of joy, I breathed a sigh of relief - knowing a significant pressure was lifted and my year-long hard work paid off. Finally, I could share this achievement with my parents and make them happy.

Out of all these pertinent reasons, I wonder whether I have left out the most important reason: the love for Mathematics that could fuel a lifetime of learning. 

### 1. An Unlikely Spark
When I was in primary school and brought into my first after-school lesson, I revolted at the idea - against my parents and my teachers. I could not conceive of any reason why they would force me into two extra hours of lessons at the end of each school day to study some more. However, as vehement as my reaction to extra lessons was, my anger quickly dissipated when my teacher began to write down problems on the whiteboard. He began introducing geometry, algebra, and combinatorial problems that felt so foreign yet immersed me in hypotheticals that gripped my imagination. Through these problems, he showed me new ways of looking at the world - through lenses that filled the world with patterns and structure. Within less than a month, coming to after-school lessons for math became my favorite part of the day - and I had formed a tight-knit group of friends that became my greatest source of motivation to learn and of knowledge as well.

### 2. Crackling
Throughout middle school, my practice was taking me far. The problems became harder, but I also acquired more techniques and familiarity with a wider range of topics. I began winning some awards at local and national levels. I was proud of myself - the same type of joy, I suppose, where one beats one's opponents in a sporting match, but it was an intellectual battle. My desire for the competition was fierce. 

### 2. Smothered
Then came high school. The pressure of getting into a good college was severe, and for me, a natural crutch was to do so was the one thing I had felt most confident about in my academia: my ability to perform well in Math competitions. 
Among the math competitions in the US, the most prestigious and well-recognized were offered by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA). It organized a series of examinations to determine the best high school competitive mathematicians in the nation, ultimately to pick out the top 6 to represent the US at the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO). My goal entering high school was to acquire the highest stage I could. Amongst all the people I knew, no one had represented the US on the IMO team, but I knew one person Peter, at my high school who qualified for the USAJMO (the exam preceding final IMO where the top 400 test-takers in the national qualifier for). That became my goal. Although freshman year I had missed the cutoff by a few points, I returned more determined the following year and regularly practiced with Peter (the other USAJMO qualifier) with determination to qualify for it, no matter what. And ultimately, I did. It was a grueling process for both of us, and I will gladly admit that it was one of the proudest things I accomplished. 

### 3. Realization
However, when Covid came in 2020, the AMC and AIME tests were canceled, and I was left without the goal I had been training towards for the year. Sometimes, one's true intention reveals itself when one is allowed to make decisions without any pressure. Over the pandemic, because the tests were canceled, I noticed I had dropped something that was entirely crucial to my life: I stopped learning mathematics. Completely.

### 4. Rekindle
Thus, I realized that, under the grueling pressure to perform well in competition, Mathematics has become meaning and not the end. What was once a profound source of excitement and curiosity for me has now become a chore, bearing constant tension.
However, now that I am in college, I realize I had been wrong to let my love for the subject go. In Computer Science, I can witness again the prevalence of Math through every aspect of the subject. From AI to cryptography, Math finds itself in every corner of the application. Ultimately, I realize Math provides us with frameworks to think about the world, and only through new frameworks can we view the world in novel ways. I believe now that I am in college and finding friends who study the subject for its pure beauty, I have rediscovered the excitement I once had as a kid in after-school lessons poring over gripping problems.
I am now pursuing a Mathematics dual major - no longer for the appellation but for the joy it brings me to learn. And a new fire had begun.
