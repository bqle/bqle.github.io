*I wish I could say I had loved Mathematics all my life, but that is not the case.*

<!--more-->
On many accounts, the proudest achievement I have had within mathematics has been to achieve the USAJMO stage in 10th grade. When my teacher told me the news, instead of a bolt of joy, I breathed a sigh of relief - knowing a significant pressure had been lifted, and that my year-long hard work paid off, and that I could share this achievement with my parents and make them happy.

Out of all these pertinent reasons, I wonder whether I have left out the most important reason of all: the love for Mathematics that could fuel a lifetime of learning. 

### 1. An Unlikely Spark
When I was in primary school and brought into my first after-school lesson, I revolted at the idea - against my parents and my teachers. I could not conceive of a reason why they would force me into two extra hours of lessons at the end of each school day to study some more. However, as vehement as my reaction to the idea was my anger quickly dissipated as the problems that my teacher began to write down on the whiteboard. Geometry problems, algebra, and combinatorics immersed me in hypotheticals that felt to me so real and showed me new invigorating ways of looking at the world. Within less than a month, coming to afterschool lessons for math became my favorite part of the day - and I had formed a tight-knit group of friends that were my greatest source of motivation to learn and of knowledge as well.

### 2. Crackling
Throughout middle school, my practice was taking me far. The problems became harder, but I also acquired more techniques and more familiarity with a wider range of topics. I was winning some awards at a local and national level. I was proud of myself - the same type of joy, I suppose, where one beats one's opponents in a sporting match, but this time it was an intellectual game. My desire for competition was strong -

### 2. Smothered
Then, came high school. The pressure of getting into a good college was severe, and for me, the natural crutch for me to do so was the one thing I had felt most confident about in my academia: my ability to perform well in Math competitions. 
Amongst the high school competitions in the US, the most prestigious and well-recognized were offered by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA). They offered what would be the series of examinations to determine the best high school competitive mathematicians in the nation, ultimately to pick out the top 6 to represent the US at the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO). My goal entering high school was to acquire the highest stage I could. Amongst all the people I knew, no one had represented teh US at the IMO team, but I knew one person Peter, at my high school who qualified for the USAJMO (the exam preceding final IMO where the top 400 test-takers in the nation qualifier for). That became my goals. Although freshman year I had missed the cutoff by a few points, I returned more determined the next year, and regularly practice with Peter (the other USAJMO qualifier) with determination to qualify for it, no matter what. And ultimately, I did. It was a grueling process for the both of us, and I could gladly admit that it was one of the proudest things I accomplished. 

### 3. Realization
However, the next year, when Covid grew to be the most concerning global health threat in two decades, my qualifier tests were cancelled, and I was left without the goal I had been training towards for the year. Sometimes, one's true intentions are revealed when they are allowed to make decisions without any pressure. Over the pandemic, since the tests were cancelled, I noticed I had dropped something that was entirely crucial to my life: I stopped learning mathematics. Completely. 

### 4. Rekindle
Thus, I realized that affected by the grueling pressure to perform well in competition, Mathematics has become a meaning and not the end. What was once a profound source of excitement and curiosity for me has now become a chore, bearing constant tension.
However, now that I am in college, I realize that I had been wrong to let my love for the subject go. In Computer Science, I can witness again the permeation of Math through every aspect of the subject. From AI to cryptography, Math finds itself in every corner of the application. Ultimately, I realize Math provides us with frameworks for the ways we think, and only through new frameworks can we view the world in novel ways. I believe now that I am in college and finding friends who are studying the subject for its pure beauty, I have rediscovered the excitement that I once had as a kid in after-school lessons poring over gripping problems.
I am now pursuing a mathematics dual-major - no longer for the appellation but for the joy it brings me to learn. And a new fire had begun.
