## Why am I writing a blog about myself?

Woah. This is my first blog.

At the time of writing this, I am a sophomore student at the University of Pennsylvania, studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I have had many reservations about creating a website about *myself*. 

### 1. A reason to write
Firstly, I don't believe myself to be a great writer. Of course, English was not my first language - that being Vietnamese - but I am not going to blame my lack of confidence in my writing on that fact. Mainly because of my belief that people should not blame their circumstances too often when they don't have what they want. And in fact, I do want the ability to write well, so I will not pin it on my Vietnamese background that I have not acquired it. And that is why I am practicing my writing on here. This website serves as a collection of my thoughts -- and since theoretically, it has the ability to be read by strangers, it will give me the incentive to put more thought into my writing. I am making myself walk on hot coals here, but it is for a good cause. It gives me a reason to write.

### 2. A place to think
Secondly, I don't want to make a blog only about myself. I have known people who put a significant amount of time into making a nice website, with cool transitions, and fantastic photos -- and it is great and all, but it appears to me to be a bit self-conceited. I hope my website can be more than that. I want it to be a collection of not only the things I did, but why I did them -- and what guided me towards those decisions. I want it to be exploration into exciting personal (semi-anonymized) events alongside interesting technical questions & concepts I have come across.

I want to use this expanded document as a place to collect my thoughts and reflect upon my decisions. Whether good or bad, they will come to bare, and I can present them honestly. I have been told by my economics professor that "Thinking is hard. If it were easy, everyone would be doing it."

### 3. A wall to present myself
Upon entering college, I was dropped head first into the world. Everyone here puts up a fantastic show to create the *ideal* first impression. I realize I am not so great at that, for I frankly don't care that much too. Often, I have realized, that it does not give people the best chance to get to know me. As a direct consequence, I do not have that great of a time to know them either. Quickly, I have realized the world runs on people -- and it is people who run the world.

It is, thus, a good idea for me to put more of myself out there so that others -- and you the reader -- to get to know me. Perhaps, we can strike up a conversation about probability, or coin collection, or the spectacle that is AI art. A piece of myself will come to fore amongst this wall of text. Life will be busy, but I hope presenting my thoughts in a wall of ```CSS``` and ```HTML``` will make it enjoyable. 

Here's to stepping out of our comfort zone!
