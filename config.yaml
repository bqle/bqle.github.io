      I am an undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I love developing useful
      products, solving difficult problems, and learning along the way. I have a diverse set of skills involving software engineering, web
      development, and project management. Earlier in my life, I participated in lots of competitive math and physics 
      which helped develop my analytical skills and inituition for first-principle approaches. In my free time, I love learning about 
      algorithms & software design, playing soccer, and jamming on the guitar.

                of financial documents. There, I developed efficient algorithms for extracting key fields from invoices, clustering algorithms 
                to identify key templates from a dataset of 100k+ images. To culminate my internship, I proposed and developed a REST API wrapper with over 60 endpoints and 2000 lines of code around the Federal Reserve's 
                new FedNow service that allows banks to clear and settle transfers near real-time. I received commendation from the CEO for my speed of development, organization, robustness, and
